# Supabase Storage Setup

## âœ… Storage Bucket Created Successfully

The storage bucket has been automatically created using MCP (Model Context Protocol). No manual setup required!

### Bucket Configuration âœ…
- **Bucket name**: `avatars`
- **Public**: Yes (for public access to avatar images)
- **File size limit**: 5MB (5,242,880 bytes)
- **Allowed file types**: image/*

### Security Policies âœ…
The following Row Level Security (RLS) policies have been created:

1. **"Users can upload their own avatars"** - Users can only upload files to their own UUID folder
2. **"Users can view their own avatars"** - Users can view files in their own folder
3. **"Users can update their own avatars"** - Users can update files in their own folder  
4. **"Users can delete their own avatars"** - Users can delete files in their own folder
5. **"Public can view avatars"** - Anyone can view avatar images (for directory/profile viewing)

### Folder Structure
The app automatically organizes images as:
```
avatars/
â””â”€â”€ {user-uuid}/
    â””â”€â”€ avatar-{timestamp}.{ext}
```

This ensures each user has their own folder and only stores the latest profile image.

### Status: Ready to Use! ðŸŽ‰
Your profile image upload functionality is now fully configured and ready to use.
